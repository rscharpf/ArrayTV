  abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read
	coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This
	bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus
	on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number
	estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples;
	and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in
	a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns,
	and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It
	is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced
	read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal:
	both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented
	in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the
	hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We
	propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level,
	allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream
	smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform
	other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

abstract ={Motivation: Changes in the copy number of chromosomal DNA segments [copy number variants (CNVs)] have been implicated in human variation, heritable diseases and cancers. Microarray-based platforms are the current established technology of choice for studies reporting these discoveries and constitute the benchmark against which emergent sequence-based approaches will be evaluated. Research that depends on CNV analysis is rapidly increasing, and systematic platform assessments that distinguish strengths and weaknesses are needed to guide informed choice.Results: We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of six platforms, provided by four leading vendors, using a spike-in experiment. NimbleGen and Agilent platforms outperformed Illumina and Affymetrix in accuracy and precision of copy number dosage estimates. However, Illumina and Affymetrix algorithms that leverage single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) information make up for this disadvantage and perform well at variant detection. Overall, the NimbleGen 2.1M platform outperformed others, but only with the use of an alternative data analysis pipeline to the one offered by the manufacturer.Availability: The data is available from http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/cnvcomp/.Contact: pevsner@jhmi.edu; fspencer@jhmi.edu; rafa@jhu.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	copy number. Newly developed microarray technologies enable simultaneous
	measurement of copy number at thousands of sites in a genome. We
	have developed a modification of binary segmentation, which we call
	circular binary segmentation, to translate noisy intensity measurements
